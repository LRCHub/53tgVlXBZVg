(Diese kleine unheimliche
Insel hat mich zu einer
Waffe gemacht)
(Wir glauben beide-)
(Cette petite île étrange
a fait de moi une arme)
(Nous croyons tous les deux
que nous pouvons l'utiliser
pour changer l'élan
de cette guerre)
(Esta pequeña isla misteriosa
me ha convertido en un arma)
(Todos creemos que podemos
usarla para cambiar el impulso
de esta guerra)
Welcome back to Trench
Welcome back to Trench
I created this world
To feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
Earned my stripes
Three hundred tracks
in my Adidas track jacket
Bless your ear holes
while you react
Actin' gobsmacked,
don't hesitate to maybe
overcompensate
I feel like I was just here,
same twitchin' in my eyes
Don't sleep on a boy
who can fall asleep twice
In the same night and won't
hesitate to maybe overcompensate
I said I fly by the dangerous
bend symbol
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
We don't hesitate to maybe
overcompensate
And then by the time I catch,
in my peripheral
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
We don't hesitate to maybe
overcompensate
Where am I from?
I was born right here, just now
Originated right
in front of your eyes
If you can't see, I am Clancy
Prodigal son, done running,
come up with Josh Dun
Wanted dead or alive
So now you pick who you serve
You bow to the masses
Get kicked to the curb
For passin' the classes
Half empty, half full,
save half of your taxes
Then overtake your former self
I fly by the dangerous
bend symbol
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
We don't hesitate to maybe
overcompensate
And then by the time I catch,
in my peripheral
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
We don't hesitate to maybe
overcompensate
Days feel like a perfect length
I don't need them any longer
But for goodness sake
Do the years seem way too short
for my soul, corazón
Way too short for my soul,
corazón
The days
feel like a perfect length
I don't need them any longer
But for goodness sake
Do the years seem way too short
for my soul, corazón
Way too short for my soul,
corazón
Earned my stripes
Three hundred tracks
in my Adidas track jacket
Bless your ear holes
while you react
Actin' gobsmacked don't hesitate
to maybe overcompensate
I said I fly by the dangerous
bend symbol
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
We don't hesitate to maybe
overcompensate
And then by the time I catch,
in my peripheral
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
We don't hesitate to maybe
overcompensate
